# AIM : 
   Arranging the given array of elements in sorted array.
# DESCRIPTION :
   Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm which is used to sort the given array of elements.Bubble sort is sinking sort.It compares the adjacent elements and swaps if the numbers are in the wrong order .The algorithm which is a comparision sort is named for the way smaller or larger elements "bubble" to the top of the list.
   
# STEP BY STEP PROCEDURE:
   1. Declare the array with a specific index.
   2. Compare the adjacent two elements starting from the array initial position.
   3. If the second element is smaller than the first element then the second element gets swaped to the first place.
   4. The process gets repeated until the whole array gets sorted.
   5. print the sorted array.
   
 # OUT PUT OBTAINED:
 OUTPUT 1:
 Give input as array a[10] = {8,5,2,3,6,9,1,4,7,0} by going through bubble sort function it checks whether the array is sorted or not . If not it sorts the array and gets swapped .it returns the output as {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}
 OUTPUT 2:
  Give input as array a[10] = {0,-1,-2,-3,5,8,9,6,3,-10} by going through bubble sort function it checks whether the array is sorted or not . If not it sorts the array and gets swapped .it returns the output as {-10,-3,-2,-1,0,3,5,6,8,9}
  OUTPUT 3:
   Give input as array a[10] = {0,1,1,2,2,77,55,88,96,0} by going through bubble sort function it checks whether the array is sorted or not . If not it sorts the array and gets swapped .it returns the output as {0,0,1,1,2,2,55,77,88,96}
